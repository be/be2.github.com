A compilation of proofs that P (you might as well refer to them as 'that :P'). Found this material @David Chalmers' [consc.net](http://consc.net/misc/proofs.html), which includes a number of resources as well as~ quite a bit of his own work, and @[Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/rb0de/17_proofs_that_p_aka_lets_make_fun_of_famous):

_Frank Jackson_ 

>The folk think that not-p. But I just called them "the folk". Therefore, p.

_Strawson_ 

>Only philosophers would think that not-p. Therefore, p.

_Fodor_ 

>My argument for p is based on three premises:

    1. q
    
    2. r
    
    and
    
    3. p

>From these, p deductively follows. Some people may find the third premise controversial, but it is clear that if we replaced that premise by any other reasonable premise, the argument would go through just as well.

_Derrida_ 

>P, but P carries also the trace of not-P.

_Putnam_

>Some philosophers have argued that not-p, on the grounds that q. It would be an interesting exercise to count all the fallacies in this "argument". (It's really awful, isn't it?) Therefore p.

_Plantinga_

>It is a modal theorem that <>[]p -> []p. Surely its possible thatp must be true. Thus []p. But it is a modal theorem that []p -> p. Therefore p.

_Zizek_

>You know! Just yesterday morning there was an article on the problems with not-p; western democracy, charity, biogenetics, and so on...it reminds me of a joke. A wife went in to see a therapist and said, "I've got a big problem doctor. Every time we're in bed and my husband climaxes, he lets out this earsplitting yell." "My Gowd," the shrink said, "that's completely natural. I don't see what the problem is." "The problem," she complained, "is that it wakes me up." Isn't this exactly the situation we face today with not-p? Therefore p.

_Sherlock Holmes_ 

>~a, ~b, ~c, ~d, ~e, ~f, ~g, ~h, ~i, ~j, ~k, ~l, ~m, ~n, ~o, ~q, ~r, ~s, ~t, ~u, ~v, ~w, ~x, ~y, ~z, therefore p.

_Sartre_

>As I sit here, I cannot help but experience p-ness, in-its-self. Therefore P-ness for everyone.

_Nietzsche_ 

>A casual stroll through the lunatic asylum shows that p does not prove anything.

_Plato_

>SOCRATES: Is it not true that p?
>GLAUCON: I agree.
>CEPHALUS: It would seem so.
>POLEMARCHUS: Necessarily.
>THRASYMACHUS: Yes, Socrates.
>ALCIBIADES: Certainly, Socrates.
>PAUSANIAS: Quite so, if we are to be consistent.
>ARISTOPHANES: Assuredly.
>ERYXIMACHUS: The argument certainly points that way.
>PHAEDO: By all means.
>PHAEDRUS: What you say is true, Socrates.
