Ever wanted to mess with your co-worker's computer? Now you've got the chance and it's very easy. Every now and then we need to browse the internet in our jobs. Well, if you get things right, when your huffy friend starts her google chrome (works also with firefox) she will find something like this:

![cssmess](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5666518/cssmess.jpg)

The github repository name is `aprilfools.css`, self explanatory, which was released a little bit earlier in march. So, all you gotta do is to clone this baby by opening your terminal and typing:

    $ git clone https://github.com/wesbos/aprilFools.css.git

Now that you have got the file in your computer's hd (it's good to gave them archived for further use ;-), to turn every website upside down copy the the following lines provided into your co-workers css overriding file:

    /*
      Turn every website upside down.
      Available: Chrome, Firefox
    /*
    body {
    	-webkit-transform: rotate(180deg);
    }

Now you wonder where the original css are located, aka "where the hell do I put this code?!" moment. So, there's the different configs locales:

Mac Chrome:

    ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/User StyleSheets/Custom.css

Windows Chrome: 

    C:/Users/YourUsername/AppData/Local/Google/Chrome/User Data/Default/User StyleSheets/Custom.css

Linux (Chromium): 

    ~/.config/chromium/Default/User StyleSheets/Custom.css

Firefox - Windows, Mac & Linux:

    YOUR_FIREFOX_PROFILE/chrome/userContent.css
