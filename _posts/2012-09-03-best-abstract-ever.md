This abstract from a mathematical physics paper is the best article summary I've ever read:

J. E. Avron, L. Sadun, J. Segert and B. Simon, “Chern numbers, quaternions, and Berry’s phases
in Fermi systems,” Communications in Mathematical Physics, vol. 124, pp. 595-627, 1989

>Abstract: Yes, but some parts are reasonably concrete.
