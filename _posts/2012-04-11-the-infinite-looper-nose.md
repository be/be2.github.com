Bro, check this out. If Pinocchio says "my nose will grow now" *believing* that it won't, he's telling a lie and his nose grows(1). It turns out that he now speaks truly - keep in mind what Pino said and what (would've) happened -, therefore his nose doesn't grow. But again the statement turns out to be a lie, since he belives that his nose won't grow and he speaks that it will, and his nose grows againâ€¦ ya dig? A paradox, Pinocchio's nose would stuck on a damn loop - if assumed that he believes he's telling a lie.

But this shit goes deeper. If assumed that this motherfucker *believes* he's telling the truth, the sack of shit remains a paradox. Dawg Pino says that he's fucking nose will grow 'now' believing it fucking will. He's not lying at all, he fucking believes it will, dog, wtf?! Of course that shit doesn't grow, but wait, shit, he said it would grow and it didn't. Aight. Now wot? Now this motherfucker big nose strikes again, and that shit goes on and on.

If ya get all fucked up about the fact that for the sentence to count as a lie you need more than a belief, that you need someshit like a definite truth value, I say, yo dude, that shit isn't important because it turns the whole fucking case too strong. 'Lies' don't depend on the truth value of the proposition. You can't say you lied about an information that you transmited if you believed it was true, even it it was false all the time (not information, disinformation or misinformation) - you just didn't know, you wasn't lying. We can simply admit that motherfucking jackass Pinocchio was truly believing his shitty nose would grow (deliberate intent not to deceive) or wouldn't grow (deliberate intent to deceive), rather than sate that his belief was TRUE of FALSE, ya dig? Don't. So fuck you!

P.S. - This [dude](http://www.reilaos.com/post/890247696/pinocchio-and-the-energy-crisis) says Pino's nose would fucking oscillate, damn.

Got inspiration from this [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/fuckingphilosophy/comments/s3640/pinocchio_paradox) @fuckingphilosophy.

(1). 'Would grow' for the sake of the loop.
