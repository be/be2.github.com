##Frequently Asked Questions##

#HOW DO I CONNECT TO .I2P SITES?#

We recommend you to use the Tor Browser. A visual tutorial on setting up the Tor Browser for use with .i2p sites can be found here: http://i.imgur.com/gwInM2e.png Plaintext: 

1. Make sure I2P is running. Launch the Tor Browser. (Get it at https://torproject.org/)

2. Open the Torbutton Preferences.

3. Select "Use custom proxy settings". Set HTTP Proxy to 127.0.0.1 and the corresponding Port to 4444. Click "OK".

HOW DO I CONNECT TO I2P IRC SERVERS THAT ARE NOT PART OF IRC2P?

A visual tutorial can be found here: http://i.imgur.com/PxZLa.png
Plaintext:

1. http://127.0.0.1:7657/i2ptunnel/wizard

2. Select Client Tunnel -> click next

3. Select IRC for tunnel type -> click next

4. Name is whatever, description is whatever -> click next

5. Tunnel Destination is one of the below addresses (i.e. irc.puredev.i2p) -> click next

6. Set port to be an unused port like 6666 -> click next

7. Check AutoStart -> click Finish

8. Connect irc client to server at localhost on whatever port you chose in step 6 (don't use a proxy)

###HOW DO I CONNECT TO OTHER I2P SERVICES?###

Just do what you do when connecting to a non-irc2p IRC server. Point the appropriate client to the localhost:port combination that you set up for the tunnel.

###CAN I USE I2P TO ACCESS NON-.I2P SITES AND SERVICES?###

You can, but I2P is not built with proxy functionality in mind. There are some outproxies that allow you to access the clearnet though.

###WHAT IS A "B32"?###

TL;DR: a b32 is I2P's equivalent of an IP address. Longer explanation: The b32 is a "compressed" version of the b64, which is the actual destination key of an I2P service. All human-readable links are simply shortcuts for destination keys. This can be compared regular clearnet DNS, though I2P's "DNS system" (the address book) is completely local and only contacts I2P "name registrars" like stats.i2p or inr.i2p to get newly published addresses periodically.

###ISN'T RELAYING TRAFFIC FOR OTHERS DANGEROUS?###

You  are not acting as a proxy. You are relaying encrypted traffic of which  you know neither the source nor the destination. Depending on your country, there is usually close to zero risk involved in running a non-exit Tor relay. Relaying in I2P is no different.

###ISN'T JAVA VERY INSECURE?###

Not really. The "Java vulnerabilities" you usually hear about are in the Java browser plugin. You don't need that anyway (so get rid of it if you haven't already!).
