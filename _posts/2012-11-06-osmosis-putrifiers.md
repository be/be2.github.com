I have two short announcements to make. The first is that I finally know my favourite movie quote ever :P It's from the piece of art called **Osmosis Jones** (2001), starring Bill Murray, Chris Rock and Laurence Fishburne. Check it out. 

**Frank** (Bill Murray):

## "99 kinds of wings! 128 different dipping sauces! You love math, crunch the numbers on that - and tell me the possibilities arent INFINITE!" ##

The other news is that San Francisco's band *The Oh Sees* realeased a new album called **Putrifiers II**. I found it  pretty good, could even say that it has its moments of Velvet on sedatives and Underground on anphetamines   ;-)
