I have two important announcements to make. The first is that I finally know my favourite movie quote ever :P It's from the piece of art called Osmosis Jones (2001), starring Bill Murray, Chris Rock and Laurence Fishburne. Digg it: 

Frank (Bill Murray):

##99 kinds of wings! 128 different dipping sauces! You love math, crunch the numbers on that - and tell me the possibilities arent INFINITE!##

The other news is that San Francisco's band *The Oh Sees* realeased a new album called ##Putrifiers II##. It's pretty amazing, could say it's like Velvet on opium and cocaine at the same time   ;-)   ///Hasta hermanos.
