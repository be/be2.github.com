Hackitat is a film about political hacking, world wide. It presents some good questions such as:

>What compels some people to spend a lot of time and energy on setting up servers, creating programs and even committing crimes to help people in a dictatorship in another country to communicate freely? Who are the people building a nation on the Internet and why are they doing it? How are the hackers in Bolivia working to integrate indigenous languages into computer software so that all people can access the technology? Who are the hackers in the middle east that some call terrorists and some call freedom activists. What drives this activism and does anonymous in Bahrain share a common ideology with anonymous in Brazil?

Help out on [Indiegogo](http://www.indiegogo.com/hackitat-a-film-about-political-hacking-world-wide) to make this film.
